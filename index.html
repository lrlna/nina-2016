      They have been used as models of physical and biological phenomena, such as fluid flow, galaxy formation, earthquakes, and biological pattern formation. They have been considered as mathematical objects about which formal properties can be proved. They have been used as parallel computing devices, both for the high-speed simulation of scientific models and for computational tasks such as image processing.
